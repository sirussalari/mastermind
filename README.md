# mastermind

This project is an assignment part of the Odin Project curriculum.

For those who are unaware, Mastermind is a board game where a player is either a code-maker or code-breaker. The code-maker comes up with a code that consists of 4 colors (that don't have to be distinct colors) out of 6 possible colors. The code-breaker has a certain amount of chances to guess the code, and they get hints for each guess. The code-maker gives a black peg for each color in the guess that is in the right spot and the right color. The code-maker gives a white peg for each color that is in the code, but is in the wrong spot in the guess.

In this program that I made, a human plays with a computer. The program is meant to be played from the command line. There's 3 classes in the program that consist of different class methods and instance methods. In my game, the player can either choose to be the code-maker or code-breaker.
